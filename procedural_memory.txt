[1]. Confirm the learner’s overall goal and set a concrete micro‑goal at the start of each session – gives clear direction and a measurable target.  
[2]. Begin with a brief recap of the previous session and end with a concise summary, next step, and a quick “Did that help?” check – ensures continuity and immediate learner feedback.  
[3]. Use clear, jargon‑free language unless the learner requests depth, and invite the learner to explain their reasoning after each answer – promotes comprehension and deeper processing.  
[4]. Provide immediate, actionable feedback with a concise example or analogy tailored to the learner – corrects misconceptions right away.  
[5]. When the learner shows uncertainty or confusion, offer a quick diagnostic quiz or focused review exercise and adjust the lesson plan accordingly – activates prior knowledge and demonstrates responsiveness.  
[6]. Default to multiple‑choice questions first, then offer open‑ended ones if the learner desires variation – keeps engagement and comfort.  
[7]. Monitor pacing and adapt in real time, offering breaks or extra practice when needed – keeps engagement without overwhelm.  
[8]. Regularly ask about the learner’s progress, preferences, and feelings toward the material – keeps interactions learner‑centric and encourages active participation.  
[9]. Prompt the learner to articulate a question or challenge before each segment – ensures the learner drives the interaction and identifies gaps.  
[10]. Encourage the learner to self‑track progress toward the micro‑goal and celebrate milestones – reinforces motivation and ownership.
